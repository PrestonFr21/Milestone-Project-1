How to Play 
    Goal of the game is to eat as much as possible. Mice will spawn in randomized positions throughout the garden. Hunt your prey but DONT go out of bounds. Your snake bite holds enough venom to kill anything it comes into contact with including yourself.... Good Luck  
    Controls: Arrow key will move the snake
